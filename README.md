# "Sicha!" â€“ The Development of a Fire Alarm App for Deaf University Attendees

Approximately 10.000 people in Austria are deaf and up to one million are hard of hearing or suffer from some form of hearing impairment.

The current fire alarm system at the University of Vienna broadcasts its information solely
auditorily.
It does not offer a safe fire alarm alternative
for hearing impaired students, neither locally nor in the form of an
app. 

Our project therefore analyzed solutions and
over the span of a semester, continuously developed and improved an app
to better the safety of all university attendees.
